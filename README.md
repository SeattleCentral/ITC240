## Course Description

Covers the fundamentals of programming using a server-side scripting language such as PHP Hypertext Preprocessor (PHP). Students learn basic programming skills in order to manage variables, control structures, and arrays and to elegantly incorporate their scripts into their websites to create dynamic web pages and gather data from HTML forms.
Prereq: WEB 110 with 2.0 or higher or instructor's permission.

**Prerequisites:** WEB 110 with a grade of 2.0 or higher or permission.
 
## Course Goals

Upon Completion of this course, students will be able to:
			
1. Understand the fundamentals of an HTTP request cycle.
2. Be able to setup and configure a web server to serve dynamic content.
3. Become familiar with the PHP programming language.
4. Use PHP to follow DRY (don't repeat yourself) best practices.
5. Use PHP to parse user input and track user sessions.
4. Securely interface with a database using PHP.


## Textbook:

None required.

However, an AWS account will be required.

## Assignments/Projects

Regular assignments will be posted in Canvas. All assignments are designed to give the student practice with new skills, concepts, and tools covered in class.

Your homework must be turned in on time. Late submissions may be granted partial credit when accompanied by an ingenuitive excuse. Generally speaking, students will learn more if coursework is up-to-date with the lecture. Unfortunately, assignments turned in after course end will receive 0 points. 

To receive full credit, your completed assignment should perform the required functionality and, if specified, use the techniques learned during class. Additionally, all code must meet coding style guidelines. 

Students will have 1 additional week to correct code rejected for not meeting style guidelines. 

Assignments are worth 20 points each.

## Quizzes/Exams

There will be multiple Quizzes, a Midterm, and a Final Exam. Quizzes will normally be administered in class and may be “group efforts.” Missing a Quiz due to absence will be addressed on a case-by-case basis. In most cases, makeups will be allowed unless absences become problematic. The Midterm and Final Exam will include multiple choice questions, short answer, writing short code snippets, and identifying errors in printed code. Quizzes are worth 20 points each. The Midterm and Final Exam are worth 100 points each.

## Materials

An Amazon AWS account. Creating an account does require a credit card.

We will attempt to remain within the free tier, but each student is responsible for their own billing.

## Attendance 

While regular attendance is not technically mandatory, in practice, it usually is. This is by design to mimic “real life” scenarios. Often times, showing up is the most important thing. And being present for lectures, quizzes, and code reviews will greatly improve your grade.  

This is a programming class and you need to be prepared to work hard and to spend an adequate amount of time outside of the classroom coding.   

## Helping / Working with Others

I encourage you to work with other class members, which is how real life software is produced. However,  you must hand in your own assignments. If found cheating,  you will receive no credit and be subject to college disciplinary action. For more information, refer to your Academic Dishonesty Policy in the college catalog or student handbook.

## Accessibility

Students with documented disabilities requesting class accommodations, requiring special arrangements in case of building evacuation, or have emergency medical information the instructor should know about are asked to contact the disability support services office (DSS) in BE1112. Once the disability is verified with DSS the student will be given a letter of accommodation (LOA) to be handed to instructor.

# Americans with Disability Act (ADA) (BE1112)

Students with documented disabilities requesting class accommodations, requiring special arrangements in case of building evacuation, or have emergency medical information the instructor should know about are asked to contact the disability support services office (DSS) in BE1112. Once the disability is verified with DSS the student will be given a letter of accommodation (LOA) to be handed to instructor.

## Accommodation Process:

- If a student contacts the instructor about an accommodation request the instructor will refer the student to the Disability Support Service office in BE1112 for an appointment to discuss accommodation needs.

- If the DSS office determines that the student does indeed have a disability the student will be given a letter of accommodation (LOA) that will state the accommodation to be implemented.

- The student’s responsibility is to hand the LOA to the instructor. The instructor will sign the letter (if there is agreement with the accommodation) and give it back to the student. Student will return the LOA to DSS.
